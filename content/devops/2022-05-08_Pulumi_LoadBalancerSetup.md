### Introduction

Recently I started experimenting with Pulumi. The initial set of posts were focused on using Pulumi to create resources on AWS. Check out [this](https://blog.wimwauters.com/devops/2022-03-28-pulumi_createec2_defaultvpc/), or [this](https://blog.wimwauters.com/devops/2022-04-03-pulumi_createec2_existingvpc/), or [this](https://blog.wimwauters.com/devops/2022-04-06-pulumi_createec2_newvpc/) post to get started with Pulumi and AWS.

In the upcoming post, we will create a loadbalander setup with multiple droplets. In fact, a very similar setup than the one we created with Terraform in [this](http://localhost:1313/devops/2022-02-20_terraform_loadbalancersetup/) post. I just wanted to get a bit of a feel how 'different' Pulumi is when compared to Terraform.
