Thanks for dropping by at my technology blog! My name is Wim Wauters, 42 year old guy living in Belgium, father of 2 lovely daughters and 2 lovely stepdaughters. I’m a Solutions Architect in the European datacenter/cloud team in Cisco Advanced Services.

I love technology … a lot! Ranging from hardware based tools (e.g Raspberry Pi, ESP8266…) to networking architecture (e.g. datacenter, virtualization…) to software development (e.g. web frameworks, scripting, automation tools …) to Cloud technologies (e.g. AWS, Azure, Openstack, Docker, Kubernetes…). 

Although I love technology a lot, I have to admit that it’s difficult to keep up with all the latest and greatest technologies and the variety of tools out there. There’s a lot to learn each day if you want to keep up with current market trends!

To that extend, I’m a firm believer that maintaining a generalist approach is often better than a specialist approach. I find that it is definitely an asset to know quite a bit about a lot of different technologies and tools. Therefore, I always try to maintain a general knowledge on what I consider the most relevant stuff for my day to day work.



So why this blog… In today’s fast paced world, I have to admit that sometimes it’s already difficult to remember what exactly I did yesterday, let alone I remember why I used a certain tool and even worse, how I configured a certain application all these months or years ago. I try to convince myself this is not because I’m slowly getting older, but that it’s just a side effect of all these new technologies and tools that come out every day

You’ll find many different tools on this blog that I’ve experimented with. It certainly does not mean I’m an expert in all of them. I don’t consider myself a good programmer for instance, but mostly I develop something that gets the thing done. Also, mostly I’m even just scratching the surface of a certain technology so that I have enough luggage to understand how a particular application or technology works. It just helps me to better understand the bigger picture (and how they all interact with each other) for all of these technologies. Other people obviously might have other methodologies.

I think the summary is that this blog serves a bit as my ‘memory’. It answers questions like: why did I experiment with a certain tool, how did I end up configuring that tool, how does this web framework connect to a database again, what’s the benefit of X over Y…. I noticed that every now and them, I revert back to these posts to remember the exact syntax or to even remember what a certain tool did again. So this blog mainly serves my own needs. But I thought that -as it is sometimes useful for me- it could also be useful for some of you out there. It’s my way to give something back to the community…I hope you will find something useful here every now and then.

If you wish to contact me, don’t hesitate to contact me through this blog’s contact page…

Regards,

Wim
