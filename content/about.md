Thanks for dropping by at my technology blog! My name is Wim Wauters, 42 year old guy living in Belgium. I’m a Solutions Architect in the European datacenter/cloud team at Cisco. 

I love technology a lot! In my day to day job I come across a wide variety of technologies such as networking, private and public cloud, automation, network programmability..and I continue to experiment in my free time. Learning nevers stops, we all need to improve ourselves continuously, certainly in today's fast pacing world. It's an ever evolving part of being an architect and I like that. Let it be said that it certainly is not always easy to keep up with all the latest and greatest technologies and the variety of tools out there. There’s a lot to learn each day if you want to keep up with current market trends.

And let this be the exact reason why I'm maintaining this blog. It's my little project to ensure I document all the things I'm involved with. All the posts you come across here are like small brain dumps of something I learned along the way. I hope they will serve you as well some day. 

You’ll find many different tools or technologies on this blog. It certainly does not mean I’m an expert in all of them. I'm the type of person that needs to experiment with something before I fully understand it. In these blog posts, I’m mostly just scratching the surface on a certain technology or tool so that I have enough understanding on how to technology or tool works. And that's OK for me as I’m a firm believer that -for my job role- maintaining a generalistic approach is often far better than being a die hard specialist in a particular domain.

I noticed that every now and then, I revert back to my posts to remember the exact syntax or to even remember what a certain tool did again. So this blog mainly serves my own needs. But I thought that it sometimes could also be useful for some of you out there. So consider it my way to give something back to the community…

I hope you will find it useful and you come back every now and then to learn a thing or two.

If you wish to contact me, don’t hesitate to contact me.

Regards,

Wim
