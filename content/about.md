Thanks for dropping by at my technology blog! My name is Wim Wauters, 42 year old guy living in Belgium. I’m a Solutions Architect in the European datacenter/cloud team at Cisco. 

I love technology a lot! In my day to day job I come across a wide variety of technologies such as networking, private and public cloud, automation, network programmability.. Besides that I also like (web) programming a bit so I spend some of my spare time on that as well.

Learning nevers stops. We need to improve ourselves continuously, certainly in today's fast paced world. It's also an inherent part of being an architect. I like that but let it be said it's also sometimes frustrating. It certainly is not always easy to keep up with all the latest and greatest technologies and the variety of tools out there 

There’s a lot to learn each day if you want to keep up with current market trends. I started noting down small snippets of something I learned along the way here but truth be said that was not ideal. So I deciced to document them in a more structured way than I was doing. That's how this blog was born. It became my little project to ensure I document all the things I'm involved with. I hope my work will serve you as well some day. 

You’ll find many different tools or technologies on this blog. It certainly does not mean I’m an expert in all of them. I'm just the type of person that needs to experiment with something before I fully understand it. Hence, in these blog posts, I’m mostly just scratching the surface on a certain technology or tool. Enough for me to understand the bigger picture.

Along the way, I noticed that every now and then, I revert back to some of my posts to remember the exact syntax or to even remember what problem a particular tool was solving again. So this blog mostly serves my own needs. Most posts are written that way. But along the way I started to notice that this could also be useful for some of you out there. Consider it my way to give something back to the community…

I hope you will find it useful and you come back every now and then to learn a thing or two.

If you wish to contact me, don’t hesitate to contact me.

Regards,

Wim
