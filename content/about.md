Thanks for dropping by at my technology blog! My name is Wim Wauters, 42 year old guy living in Belgium. I’m a Solutions Architect in the European datacenter/cloud team at Cisco. 

I love technology a lot! In my day to day job I come across a wide variety of technologies such as networking, private and public cloud, automation, network programmability.. Besides that I also like (web) programming a bit so I spend some of my spare time on that as well.

Learning never stops. We need to improve ourselves continuously, certainly in today's fast paced world. In my view, it's also an inherent part of being an architect/engineer. I like that aspect but let it be said it's also sometimes frustrating. The IT world seems to move faster than I can process new stuff. There’s a lot to learn each day if you want to keep up with current market trends. 

I always kept notes of things I learned along the way. That was not really ideal. So I deciced to document them in a more structured way than I was doing. That's how this blog was born. It became my little project to ensure I document all the things I'm involved with. I hope my work will serve you as well some day. 

You’ll find many different tools or technologies on this blog. It certainly does not mean I’m an expert in all of them. I'm just the type of person that needs to experiment with something before I fully understand it. Hence, in these blog posts, I’m mostly just scratching the surface on a certain technology or tool. Enough for me to understand the bigger picture.

Along the way, I noticed that quite often I revert back to some of my older posts to look something up, to verify the exact syntax of something or to even remember what problem a particular tool was solving again. So this blog mostly serves my own needs. Most posts are written that way. But along the way I started to notice that this could also be useful for some of you out there. Consider it my way to give something back to the community…

I hope you will find it useful and you come back every now and then to learn a thing or two.

If you wish to contact me, don’t hesitate to contact me.

Regards,

Wim
