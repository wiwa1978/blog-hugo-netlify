## What is Netmiko

Netmiko is a multi-vendor SSH Python library which makes connecting to network devices via SSH really easy and straightforward. The library  simplifies SSH management to network devices is based on the Paramiko SSH library.

As per the documentation, the purposes of this library are the following:

- Successfully establish an SSH connection to the device
- Simplify the execution of show commands and the retrieval of output data
- Simplify execution of configuration commands including possibly commit actions
- Do the above across a broad set of networking vendors and platforms

## Why Netmiko

The question is: if we have Paramiko, why would be need something like Netmiko. As it turns out, Paramiko can sometimes be quite hard to work with. Netmiko is hiding many details of common devive communication. It uses Paramiko for the underlying SSH connectivity, but provides a higher abstraction for the communication with networking devices.
